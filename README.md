### Our Mission

Our project asks if the user is a professor or a student. If the user is a professor, the user is routed to a page to make a lecture. The next page shows the section number and the overall average rating until the session is over, then routing to a session over page. If the user is a student, the user is either routed to a No Session page if the session is not running, or if a session is running, the page displays the current section number and gives an option to rate the class. Once the student clicks on a rating, the student is redirected to a page that displays the chosen rating.

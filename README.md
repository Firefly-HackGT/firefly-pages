### Our Mission
Just like fireflies light up the night, our project, Firefly, is here to help students and professors brighten their learning journey. Imagine a classroom where sometimes it's hard for students to grasp what's being taught. They might feel a little nervous about asking for help, and so they stay quiet. This means the teacher might not know they need some extra help.

That is where Firefly comes in. It is like a friendly guide, helping students express how well they understand a lesson, using a scale from 1 to 5. Teachers can see which areas need a little more attention, so they can explain these topics in more detail. With Firefly, we are creating a space where everyone can learn together and where no one has to feel lost or left behind. Together, we're turning on the light of knowledge, making sure no one feels in the dark about their learning.

### Project Description
Our website first asks if the user is a professor or a student. If the user is a professor, the user is routed to a page to make a lecture. The next page shows the section number and the overall average rating until the session is over, then routing to a session over page. If the user is a student, the user is either routed to a No Session page if the session is not running, or if a session is running, the page displays the current section number and gives an option to rate the class. Once the student clicks on a rating, the student is redirected to a page that displays the chosen rating.
